# Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solved in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

This is a monorepo for all years I solved. Some ideas are mine, but I often go through
[AoC subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/) after I solve the day and optimize
my solution. Some days I'm in a hurry and the code is a mess, some days I'm proud of it.

My inputs are not committed here because I respect Topaz's wish. Therefore, if you download
the repo and try to run it, you won't succeed. But you can copy your own inputs and try it that way.
